# FAQ / common problems

## The SD card is not recognised

Make sure the SD card contains only one FAT32 formatted patition. Please check on your computer and format the card if required.

## I am getting an SD not found

Please check the connections between the shields. Pushing the pins deeper into the sockets sometimes help. Also check the soldering of the pins.
